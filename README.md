README.md

The technology I used for my application were:

1. JQuery
2. Javascript
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. BootStrap (icon ONLY)

The approach I took was wire frame. I broke down all my steps on a piece of paper and included pictures. I tackled my code step by step from top to bottom of application (from nav bar to connections at bottom of application).

Problems:
Creating this portfolio website I was motivated to get out my comfort zone and try to make something awesome! I feel like in this project, I did just that. I did face a couple challenges along the way. One of the challenges I faced was repeating myself. I found myself not condensing information that could be minimized. At the end of the project, I did go back and fix most of the duplicate codes. I also found myself overthinking the process and doing things the hard way when I could have done it an easier way. Overall, through the trials and tribulations I had a good time coding and can't wait to learn more!
